# EthioMart Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) System

## Project Overview
The **EthioMart Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER)** project aims to extract key business entities such as product names, prices, and locations from unstructured text data in Amharic language Telegram messages. With the increasing use of Telegram for e-commerce activities in Ethiopia, this project provides a centralized solution for processing and analyzing product-related information from multiple independent channels.

## Objectives
- **Real-time Data Extraction**: Develop a system that collects and processes messages from various Ethiopian-based e-commerce Telegram channels.
- **Entity Recognition**: Fine-tune a pre-trained language model to accurately identify and extract entities like product names, prices, and locations.
- **Interpretability**: Implement model interpretability techniques to ensure the predictions are transparent and understandable.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3.6 or higher. Install the necessary libraries by executing the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
The project consists of several scripts for different stages of the pipeline:

Data Ingestion: Collect data from Telegram channels.

bash
python scripts/data_ingestion.py
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the raw data for labeling.

bash
python scripts/preprocess.py
Automated Data Labeling: Generate labeled data in CoNLL format for NER.

bash
python scripts/auto_labeling.py
Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune a pre-trained model on the labeled dataset.

bash
python scripts/model_finetuning.py

## Project Structure
The project follows a structured organization to enhance readability and maintainability:

bash

## Model Fine-Tuning
The fine-tuning process is performed using Hugging Face's transformers library. The project employs models like DistilBERT and XLM-Roberta, chosen for their performance in token classification tasks across multiple languages.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the NER model is evaluated using key metrics such as:

F1-score
Precision
Recall
These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly identify entities in the text.
